# Contributions

The ETH Portal Network development effort is an open, multi-team effort. If you're interested in helping contribute towards the design and implementation, join the ongoing discussion happening on the Discord server. There is also a weekly call Mondays @ 15.30 UTC, where we discuss the latest developments and open questions.
